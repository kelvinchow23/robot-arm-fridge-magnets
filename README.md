# 1:4 Scale UR3 Robot Arm â€“ Magnetic Fridge Model

A 1:4 scale 3D-printed UR3 robot arm with magnetic joints. When assembled, the arm moves like the real Universal Robot UR3 robot arm, with fully articulating joints. Each joint can also be separated and used as individual fridge magnetsâ€”and the gripper doubles as a clip.

   - UR3-Base: 4 magnets  
   - UR3-L1: 4 magnets  
   - UR3-L2: 3 magnets (2 bottom, 1 top)  
   - UR3-L3: 2 magnets  
   - UR3-L4 + UR3-L5: 2 magnets each  
   - UR3-Gripper: 1 magnet  
4. Attach caps with super glue:  
   - UR3-Base: no cap  
   - UR3-L1: UR3 Big Cap-AC  
   - UR3-L2: UR3 Big Cap-UR + UR3 Middle Cap  
   - UR3-L3: UR3 Little Cap
